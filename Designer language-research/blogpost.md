🎧 [UX Case Study] How Can Spotify Help Alex Focus Better While Studying?
👤 Persona Chosen: Alex – The Distracted Student
Alex is a 28-year-old student at Seattle University. While trying to focus during his nightly study sessions, he struggles to find the right music that helps him concentrate—especially when his roommate is around.

Despite using noise-canceling headphones, Alex is often distracted by lyrics in songs. He's looking for instrumental music with the right tempo—something that boosts focus without making him feel melancholic.

🧠 Stepping Into Alex’s Shoes
To truly understand Alex’s experience, I followed his user journey on Spotify Desktop and tried to simulate his behaviors, needs, and frustrations.

🔍 User Journey Overview
Step 1: Alex launches Spotify and looks for study music
Feeling: Hopeful
Action: Clicks "Browse" > "Genre & Moods" > "Chills"
Thoughts: “Alright, more choices…”
Pain Point: Feels disappointed by mellow, slow playlists that reduce his motivation.

Step 2: Goes back, browses other tabs (e.g., “Discover”)
Feeling: Frustrated, impatient
Thoughts: “I don’t know what I like.”
Pain Point: Feels overwhelmed by irrelevant recommendations, often influenced by his previous non-study listening habits.

Step 3: Clicks on a playlist like “Piano Ballads”
Feeling: Curious, then annoyed
Thoughts: “I like this song! I’ll save this for later… wait, how do I save it?”
Pain Point: UX confusion about saving a playlist, unclear options under the (...) menu.

Step 4: Searches “electro focus”
Feeling: Hopeful > frustrated > exhausted
Thoughts: “Why is this so difficult? Only 3 results?”
Pain Point: Search results lack clarity, filtering is poor, and genres overlap.

🔧 Opportunities for Improvement
After immersing myself in Alex’s flow, here’s a list of key UX improvement opportunities that could enhance his experience:

1. Advanced Filtering Options
Add filters such as:

🎵 Lyrics vs Instrumental

🕺 Tempo (slow, moderate, upbeat)

🧠 Mood (focus, relax, energize)

2. Tag-Based Playlist Metadata
Use machine learning to tag playlists with standardized, visible attributes. Let users filter with tags like:

#instrumental

#focus

#no-lyrics

#fast-beat

3. Quick-Access Study Mode
Create a dedicated “Study Mode” hub that includes:

Focus music only (pre-filtered)

Personalized suggestions with less than 3 clicks

Timer-based music blocks (e.g., 25 min Pomodoro with auto-playlist)

4. Improved Save Mechanism
Make the “Save Playlist” function:

Obvious (visible heart or “+” icon)

Consistent across all views (radio, search, genre)

5. Search UX Optimization
Autocomplete suggestion like “Focus + Instrumental”

Smart recommendations: “People who searched this also liked…”


💡 Part 1 – Ideation: Sketching Solutions for a Focused Listening Experience
After putting myself in Alex’s shoes and identifying key pain points, it was time to open the floodgates of creativity and brainstorm potential solutions. The goal here wasn't perfection—it was quantity and variety.

So, I sketched everything. From solid, user-centered features… to hilariously bad ideas. Why? Because even the worst ideas help challenge assumptions and trigger new thinking.

🖍️ Sketches – The Good, the Bold, and the Absurd
✅ 1. Focus Filter Bar
A new top-bar that appears when entering “Study Mode”, with options like:

Toggle for 🎧 "Instrumental Only"

Tempo slider 🐢➡️🐇

Mood buttons (Focus / Chill / Energize)

Goal: Let Alex quickly tailor the music to his study needs.

✅ 2. Smart Assistant: Playlist Builder
A short chatbot-like assistant that asks:

“Do you want lyrics?”
“What tempo suits you today?”
“How long will you study?”

Then builds a playlist accordingly.

Goal: Remove decision fatigue and help Alex discover the right mix, fast.

✅ 3. Tag-Based Playlist Navigation
Replaces genre names with interactive tags:

#instrumental

#upbeat

#focus

#deepwork

#ambient

Clicking tags dynamically reshapes results.

Goal: Clarify options and eliminate misleading titles like “Chill Vibes”.

✅ 4. One-Click Save Playlist Button
A visible, persistent ❤️ or 📌 icon next to every playlist and song, even on hover, with animation feedback.

Goal: Make saving intuitive, especially during focus time when users don’t want to dig for menus.

✅ 5. Timer-Based Focus Sessions (Pomodoro Mode)
A small widget in the corner that allows Alex to:

Choose session duration (25 min / 50 min)

Automatically queue up suitable music

Add auto-break songs after session ends

Goal: Integrate time-based productivity with music flow.

❌ The Worst Idea (on purpose!)
“Focus Music Only Unlocks After 10 Minutes of Silence”
To help users “meditate”, the app disables all playlists until you stare at a blank screen for 10 minutes. 😵‍💫

Lesson learned: Friction should reduce distractions—not create new ones.

✅ Part 2 – Decide: Choosing the Best Idea to Help Alex Focus
After generating and presenting multiple ideas to my teammate [Axel Nay], we took a step back to discuss each one critically. We evaluated them based on feasibility, impact, alignment with Alex’s frustrations, and how well they reduce friction without overwhelming the user.

🗣️ Recap of the Opportunities Found
Alex needs fast and accurate access to instrumental, focused music.

He’s overwhelmed by vague playlist titles and frustrated by poor filtering.

He often ends up with irrelevant content that wastes his time.

Saving playlists or navigating recommendations is not intuitive.

🖼️ Initial Ideas with Pros & Cons
Idea	Pros	Cons
Focus Filter Bar	Simple, visual, fast to interact with	Needs UI redesign of current player interface
Smart Assistant Playlist Builder	Personalized, removes decision fatigue	Could feel intrusive if not well integrated
Tag-Based Navigation	Clarifies browsing, visually powerful	Depends on accurate metadata tagging
One-Click Save Button	Improves UX immediately	Doesn’t solve the discovery/frustration issue
Pomodoro Music Timer	Adds productivity layer	Could be considered too niche by general users
Worst Idea: 10-min silence	Funny way to think about friction	Not helpful at all 😅

🏆 Chosen Solution: Smart Assistant – Playlist Builder

We selected the Smart Assistant because:

It directly solves Alex’s biggest problem: finding the right playlist quickly.

It removes decision fatigue by guiding the user through a short, friendly series of questions.

It doesn't require Alex to know what to search for or scroll endlessly.

It can be integrated as an optional overlay (non-intrusive) and enhanced later with machine learning.

🧠 Why This, Not the Others?
The Focus Filter Bar was tempting, but it assumes Alex knows how to use filters and what they do.

The Tag-Based Navigation requires Spotify to revamp their tagging and UI system—less feasible in short term.

The One-Click Save was helpful, but a supporting feature rather than a core solution.

The Pomodoro idea is good for a niche, but Alex’s main pain is finding, not timing.
