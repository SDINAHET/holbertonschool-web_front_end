🎧 [UX Case Study] How Can Spotify Help Alex Focus Better While Studying?
👤 Persona Chosen: Alex – The Distracted Student
Alex is a 28-year-old student at Seattle University. While trying to focus during his nightly study sessions, he struggles to find the right music that helps him concentrate—especially when his roommate is around.

Despite using noise-canceling headphones, Alex is often distracted by lyrics in songs. He's looking for instrumental music with the right tempo—something that boosts focus without making him feel melancholic.

🧠 Stepping Into Alex’s Shoes
To truly understand Alex’s experience, I followed his user journey on Spotify Desktop and tried to simulate his behaviors, needs, and frustrations.

🔍 User Journey Overview
Step 1: Alex launches Spotify and looks for study music
Feeling: Hopeful
Action: Clicks "Browse" > "Genre & Moods" > "Chills"
Thoughts: “Alright, more choices…”
Pain Point: Feels disappointed by mellow, slow playlists that reduce his motivation.

Step 2: Goes back, browses other tabs (e.g., “Discover”)
Feeling: Frustrated, impatient
Thoughts: “I don’t know what I like.”
Pain Point: Feels overwhelmed by irrelevant recommendations, often influenced by his previous non-study listening habits.

Step 3: Clicks on a playlist like “Piano Ballads”
Feeling: Curious, then annoyed
Thoughts: “I like this song! I’ll save this for later… wait, how do I save it?”
Pain Point: UX confusion about saving a playlist, unclear options under the (...) menu.

Step 4: Searches “electro focus”
Feeling: Hopeful > frustrated > exhausted
Thoughts: “Why is this so difficult? Only 3 results?”
Pain Point: Search results lack clarity, filtering is poor, and genres overlap.

🔧 Opportunities for Improvement
After immersing myself in Alex’s flow, here’s a list of key UX improvement opportunities that could enhance his experience:

1. Advanced Filtering Options
Add filters such as:

🎵 Lyrics vs Instrumental

🕺 Tempo (slow, moderate, upbeat)

🧠 Mood (focus, relax, energize)

2. Tag-Based Playlist Metadata
Use machine learning to tag playlists with standardized, visible attributes. Let users filter with tags like:

#instrumental

#focus

#no-lyrics

#fast-beat

3. Quick-Access Study Mode
Create a dedicated “Study Mode” hub that includes:

Focus music only (pre-filtered)

Personalized suggestions with less than 3 clicks

Timer-based music blocks (e.g., 25 min Pomodoro with auto-playlist)

4. Improved Save Mechanism
Make the “Save Playlist” function:

Obvious (visible heart or “+” icon)

Consistent across all views (radio, search, genre)

5. Search UX Optimization
Autocomplete suggestion like “Focus + Instrumental”

Smart recommendations: “People who searched this also liked…”
